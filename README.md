# Google Authentication

This project provides a template for complete google authentication for a react application.

Features include:
1. User identification
2. Route protection
3. User account management
4. Session handling


## Overview
Everything you need to achieve a basic user authentication using google as a service provider to Firebase has been included. All you need to add is a config file of your firebase config variables and you should be good to go. 

## Disclaimer
This is a personal project and one of my earliest independent work with react. I am aware there is a lot to do before this project is completely finished and secure. I plan to continue improving the repo until it is at such high standards, I am therefore not responsible for any problems that might occur as a result of cloning the repo.
